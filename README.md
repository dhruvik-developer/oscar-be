# Evenmore ERP — Backend

Django + DRF + PostgreSQL implementation of [api.md](api.md) (HTTP contract),
[db.md](db.md) (schema) and [api-integration.md](api-integration.md) (what the
React app expects of the server).

The React app in `Evenmore-ERP/app` now talks to this server. Its side of the
wiring is `src/services/backendSync.js` (the field mapping, one entry per
entity) plus the `persist*` helpers in `src/context/ERPContext.jsx`, which push
every create/update/delete and replace the optimistic record with the server's
copy. The contract is still api.md — the app conforms to it, not the reverse.

Run both: `python manage.py runserver` here, `npm run dev` in `Evenmore-ERP/app`.
The Vite proxy sends `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, so `VITE_API_URL` stays
relative and there is no CORS hop in development.

Each app is `models / serializers / views / urls`, plus `services.py` where the
business rules live. **The services are the interesting part** — views are thin
and mostly declarative.

---

## The rules that shaped the code

Everything below is a spec requirement that changed a design decision, not a
preference.

**The server is authoritative for every number.** api.md §5.7 ports the totals
algorithm verbatim from `ERPContext.createInvoice`; it lives in
`apps/core/money.py` and is re-run on create, on every draft edit and again at
finalization. Client-supplied totals are recomputed and rejected beyond a 0.01
tolerance. The header check constraint from db.md §3.1 is installed on all
twelve document tables, so a bug in the recompute is a loud failure rather than
a wrong ledger.

**Stock is a ledger, not a column.** `stock_movements` is append-only;
corrections are new reversing movements linked through
`original_movement`/`reversal_movement`. `availableQty`, `reservedQty` and
`status` are *not* columns on `items` — they are derived in
`apps/inventory/services.calculate_item_stock`, which is
`ERPContext.calculateItemStock` moved server-side. Weight-tracked items use
`coalesce(weighed_qty, quantity)`, so a steel receipt records the number the
weighbridge showed.

**Money and stock post together or not at all.** Finalizing an invoice
allocates the number, recomputes totals, posts `SALE` movements (skipping lines
a challan already depleted), posts Dr Debtors / Cr Sales / Cr GST, and updates
the party balance and order rollup — in one transaction.

**Derived values are never stored where they can go stale.** `Overdue`,
warranty `Expired`, contract `Expiring Soon`, HR document `Valid/Expiring
Soon/Expired` and PMS at-risk are all computed at read (db.md §12). Storing
them would need a cron job that is always a day wrong in some timezone.

**The GST split reads the company profile.** The frontend hardcodes Maharashtra;
`apps/sales/services.is_intra_state` compares the party's `place_of_supply`
against `company_profile.state`.

**The handoff gate is one function.** api.md §10.3 and db.md §10.5 both insist
`GET …/handoff-check/` and `POST …/handoff/` run the same query;
`apps/pms/services.handoff_blockers` is called by both, and returns blockers
**as data** (`{ code, label, hard }`), not as errors.

**CRM automation runs server-side.** `leadStageAutomation.js` and
`taskCompletionService.js` are `apps/crm/services.py`. A stage change returns
`{ lead, createdTasks: [] }` so the UI can toast what was generated, and the
role→user roster comes from `users.crm_roles` (`GET /crm/team-roster/`) rather
than the hardcoded `CRM_TEAM_MEMBERS`.

**Tenancy has two layers.** Every queryset is narrowed by
`TenantScopedMixin`; `manage.py enable_rls` adds Postgres RLS policies keyed on
`app.client_id`, which authentication publishes per request. Cross-tenant reads
return 404, never 403 (api.md §1.11).

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `seed_demo [--reset]` | Demo tenant built by posting real documents, so every derived number has a cause (db.md §14.1) |
| `smoke_test` | The api-integration.md §12.3 checklist over real HTTP |
| `seed_phase4_roles [--tenant <slug>]` | Seed or refresh the 12 core textile roles and permission catalogue (PDF §16) |
| `run_alerts [--tenant <slug>] [--as-of YYYY-MM-DD]` | Scheduled alert engine: runs the 13 alert checks & generates incidents (PDF §19) |
| `run_maintenance --job {hourly,nightly,all}` | The db.md §13 jobs. Reconcilers **alert, never auto-correct** |
| `enable_rls [--dry-run] [--drop]` | Install row-level security on all 160 tenant tables |

`run_maintenance` exits non-zero when it finds drift, so it can be wired
straight into an alerting cron.

`run_alerts` evaluates the 13 alert checks (delayed JWOs, pending updates, overdue samples, credit limits, etc.) and should be scheduled every 15 minutes + EOD. A check that fails is logged with its traceback and printed to stderr; the other checks still run. Thresholds come from each tenant's `AlertSetting` rows (Alert Center → settings).

There is no in-process scheduler, so schedule the command from the OS:

- **Windows Task Scheduler** (every 15 minutes):

  ```powershell
  schtasks /Create /TN "Oscar ERP alerts" /SC MINUTE /MO 15 /TR "C:\path\to\oscar-backend\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\path\to\oscar-backend\manage.py run_alerts"
  ```

- **cron** (Linux):

  ```cron
  */15 * * * * cd /srv/oscar-backend && .venv/bin/python manage.py run_alerts >> /var/log/oscar/alerts.log 2>&1
  ```

An admin (permission `manage_alerts`) can also run the checks for their own tenant on demand with `POST /api/v1/alerts/incidents/run/` (optional body `{"asOf": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`). The response lists the incidents and any checks that failed.

---

## Frontend integration

The backend satisfies the blockers listed in api-integration.md §2:

- CORS allows the dev origin plus the `Authorization` and `Idempotency-Key`
  headers (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`).
- `POST /auth/refresh/` supports the single-flight silent refresh of §5.2;
  an expired token returns **401**, never 403, so the client's
  clear-and-redirect works.
- Every financial `POST` accepts `Idempotency-Key`; a replay returns the
  original `201` body byte-for-byte.
- Every mutable entity returns `updatedAt` and accepts `If-Unmodified-Since`
  or `expectedVersion`; a conflict is `409` with the current server copy in
  `payload`.
- The aggregate endpoints §9.1.3 asks for exist, so the cross-collection
  widgets can be migrated *before* their lists are paginated:
  `/parties/{id}/summary/`, `/parties/{id}/documents/`, `/search/`,
  `/purchase/orders/auto-suggestions/`, `/inventory/items/{id}/stock/`.

Point the Vite dev proxy at `http://localhost:8000` and leave `VITE_API_URL`
relative, per api-integration.md §3.2.

**What the app reads and writes.** `backendSync.js` covers parties (and their
customer/vendor projections), categories, units, locations, items, the seven
sales documents, the three purchase documents, payments in and out, and
expenses. Everything else in `ERPContext` — PMS, HRMS, CRM stores, stock
transfers, journal entries, warranties — is still local state; the endpoints
exist, the mapping does not yet.

Three contract bugs surfaced while wiring it up and were fixed here, not
worked around in the client:

- `code` was required on party, category and location creates, so nothing the
  wizards posted could be accepted. The server allocates `CUST-`/`VEND-`
  (§1.7); category and location codes are derived from the name when omitted.
- `PurchaseOrder`/`PurchaseBill`/`PurchaseReturn` declared `vendorId` *over*
  the base serializer's `partyId`, both writable on the same source, so DRF
  demanded both. `partyId` is now a read-only mirror.
- The challan and stock-transfer viewsets had an `@action` named `dispatch`,
  which shadows `APIView.dispatch` and broke every request to those endpoints
  with a 500. Renamed, URL unchanged.

Plus two additions the client needed: `companyProfile.currency` (api.md §1.6
refers to it; the profile did not expose it) and the payment-mode enum widened
to the strings the UI's `<select>` actually emits (`Bank Transfer`, `Bank
Wire`, `ACH`, `Corporate Card`).

## Not built

Stated plainly rather than stubbed silently:

- **PDF rendering.** `/…/print/` returns the full JSON print payload (company
  profile, document, totals in words). Quotations additionally download a
  rendered PDF via `GET /sales/quotations/{id}/pdf/` (reportlab, in
  `apps/core/quotation_pdf.py`) — the same file the customer email attaches.
  Other documents' `/…/pdf/` returns `501 PDF_RENDERER_UNAVAILABLE` rather
  than a broken file.
- **Outbound email / WhatsApp.** `/…/send/` with `channel=email` delivers
  for real through Django SMTP (`EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`,
  `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`); without
  those it fails with a clear `EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED` error instead of fake
  success. Quotation emails carry the rendered quotation PDF
  (`{quotation_number}.pdf`, via `apps/core/quotation_pdf.py`) as an
  attachment. WhatsApp has no provider: `/…/send/` records the intent and says
  so (`"sent": False`). Password-reset tokens are logged, not mailed.
- **FIFO valuation.** WAC is implemented from movement unit costs (db.md
  Appendix B decision 5). FIFO needs a `stock_layers` table, so `?method=FIFO`
  reports that it is unavailable instead of quietly returning WAC.
- **xlsx / pdf export.** CSV works; the other two formats return a clear error
  rather than a mislabelled CSV.
- **Object storage.** Files use a local backend behind the same signed
  three-step flow (`upload-url` → `PUT` → `commit`), so swapping in S3 is
  confined to `apps/core/files.py`.
- **`audit_log` partitioning** — the table and its indexes match db.md §2.5;
  monthly partitioning is a migration to add before the table gets large.

## Phase 4 — Control, Alerts, Dashboards, Integrations & Compliance (PDF §16, §19, §15, §20)

### 1. Generic Approval Engine (PDF §16)
- **Models**: `ApprovalRule` (stores condition thresholds like percent variance, amount, credit days, approver role) and `ApprovalRequest` (tracks status `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected` with decision logs and comments).
- **Control points**: 13 points wired including purchase rate change, wastage above tolerance, credit limit exceeded, discount above user limit, sale below landed cost, manual stock adjustments, vendor invoice mismatch, and final PO creation.
- **Workflow**: Any document under `Pending` approval is locked against progression until authorized. Approvals inbox at `/administration/approvals` with live count badge in top navigation.

### 2. Role-Based Permissions (PDF §16)
- 12 pre-seeded roles via `python manage.py seed_phase4_roles`:
  1. Owner / Super Admin
  2. Admin
  3. Purchase Manager
  4. Production Coordinator / Salaried Production Person
  5. Godown / Inventory Manager
  6. QC Person
  7. Sales Manager
  8. Sales Executive
  9. Accounts
  10. Dispatch / Logistics
  11. HR / Payroll
  12. Read-only / Auditor
- Enforced server-side across all endpoints; non-textile modules (warranty cards, machines/serials) remain hidden.

### 3. Alerts & Exception Engine (PDF §19)
- **Runner**: `python manage.py run_alerts [--tenant <slug>] [--as-of YYYY-MM-DD]`
- Evaluates 13 alert rules (`apps/core/alert_services.py`, one `check_*` function each): missing daily production updates, delayed production/job orders, material pending with agency, loss above tolerance (only once a JWO is fully returned), high QC rejection/reprocess, negative stock, overdue invoices and credit-limit exposure, below-cost/below-margin sales, large discounts, overdue returnable samples, vendor bill three-way mismatch, slow-moving finished stock, and combined grey stock below minimum. Day/percent/amount thresholds are read from `AlertSetting`.
- **On demand**: `POST /api/v1/alerts/incidents/run/` (requires `manage_alerts`).
- **Incident Center**: In-app notifications and dedicated Alert Center page at `/administration/alerts` with severity tags, acknowledgement, and resolution workflows.

### 4. Dashboards & Owner MIS (PDF §15)
- All numbers calculated server-side from PostgreSQL models with zero client-side recomputation:
  - **Annual Commercial Leakage**: Gross sales vs party discounts, incentives, brokerage, sales returns, and sampling expenses (with ₹ amounts and % of gross sales).
  - **Party Profitability**: Customer-wise sales, COGS, discounts, brokerage, returns, and net contribution margin.
  - **Design & Colour Shade Analysis**: Fabric-wise production, sales, current balance meters, and stock ageing.
  - **Stock Ageing MIS**: 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-180, and 180+ days (slow-moving) breakdown with meter quantities and valuation.

### 5. Compliance & Integrations (PDF §20)
- **E-Invoicing & E-Way Bill**: `apps/sales/einvoice_service.py` with pluggable GSP / NIC provider interface (`EINVOICE_ENABLED`, `EINVOICE_PROVIDER`, `EINVOICE_SANDBOX_MODE`). Supports `sandbox-sim` for deterministic offline simulation and `gsp-nic` for live GST Suvidha Provider / NIC ASP integration. Generates 64-character IRN, signed QR code data, and 12-digit E-Way bills for Tax Invoices and Delivery Challans. All request/response payloads are recorded in `AuditLog`.
  > **Statutory Compliance Note (PDF §20)**: Applicable GST tax rates (CGST/SGST/IGST slabs) and the mandatory e-invoicing applicability threshold (turnover > ₹5 Cr or prevailing GST notification limit) must be validated with the client's Chartered Accountant (CA) prior to production deployment. Live NIC / GSP production credentials (`EINVOICE_CLIENT_ID`, `EINVOICE_CLIENT_SECRET`, portal username/password) must be procured through the client's registered GSP (e.g. ClearTax, Masters India, or direct NIC ASP gateway).
- **ITC-04 Statutory GST Return**: Quarterly job-work reporting at `/job-work/itc-04` covering Table 4 (goods sent to job workers), Table 5A (goods received back from job workers), and direct CSV export for GST portal submission.
