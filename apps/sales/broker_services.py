Broker commission services (PDF §12).

Tracks broker commissions linked to sales invoices:
- Status lifecycle: Accrued -> Approved -> Payable -> Partially Paid -> Paid / Hold / Cancelled.
- Support commission types: percent (of taxable invoice value), per_meter (on dispatched meters), per_taka (on dispatched takas), fixed.
- Broker payment posting: Dr Brokerage Payable / Cr Bank.
- Automatic reversal on Sales Return / Claim.
