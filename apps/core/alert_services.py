"""Alerts and Exception Management Service Engine (PDF §19).

Evaluates the 13 business exception rules, manages AlertSetting thresholds,
and logs AlertIncident rows with in-app notification dispatch.

Each rule is its own ``check_*`` function. ``run_all_alert_checks`` runs them
one by one: a rule that raises is logged and skipped, so one broken rule never
stops the others and never fails silently.
